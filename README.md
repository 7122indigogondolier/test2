# Test 2: Predicting Chance of Admission 
### Team: Utkrist P. Thapa '21, Abhi Jha '21, Tina Jin '21

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
We first identified the features of our model which were GRE score, TOEFL score, university rating, statement of purpose rating, letter of recommendation rating, cumulative GPA, research, socioeconomic status percentage, and race. The chance of admission is the output we are trying to predict. Note that serial number is omitted from the features because it is just for our reference and should not matter in predicting chance of admission. 
Then we noticed that the feature 'RACE' do not contain numerical values. [fill in explanation]
Since the measurements between each feature are different, we would need to scale the features before applying them to a model. 
Furthermore, we ran a scatter plot matrix and heat map to visualize the given dataset.
