# Test 2: Chance of Admission
### Team Rocket: Abhi Jha '21, Tina Jin '21, Utkrist P. Thapa '21

Since we needed to explore all the classifiers we have learned so far, we divided what classifiers we wanted to work on amongst ourselves in order to gauge their performance. Each of us tried various classifiers on our own, and discussed what we wanted to do via Slack. The exploratory data analysis program file was written by Tina and Utkrist, but we made sure to communicate how we wanted to deal with missing values, what scaler we would need, and what kinds of graphs and histograms to plot via Slack.

Abhi: Tested DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, and Naive Bayes (GaussianNB from sklearn)

Tina: Built linear regression, tested KNN, decision tree, random forest, did initial EDA, and part of data preprocessing and documentation pdf.

Utkrist: Built logistic regression, tested RandomForestRegressor, SVM (SVC and SVR from sklearn), plotted histograms for feature distribution, plotted graphs for hyperparameter testing, part of data preprocessing and documentation pdf.
